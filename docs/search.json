The fields that I have an interest in are sports nutrition, gut health and microbiome, and obesity. And hopefully one day, I will have the opportunity to pursue my PhD in these fields.\nEmbracing my passion for science, I find equal joy in exploring the world beyond the laboratory. Whether it’s embarking on adventurous hikes, relaxing by the shores of beautiful beaches, or immersing myself in the vibrant atmosphere of new destinations, I cherish the experiences that travel brings. In moments of leisure, I indulge in my love for sports, particularly football (aka soccer), savoring the thrill of matches. Additionally, my interests extend to a diverse array of entertainment, from captivating TV shows and engaging video games to the captivating narratives of anime. Life, to me, is a multifaceted journey blending the wonders of scientific exploration with the richness of diverse interests."
